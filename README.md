# Slack

Slack is an old school hack and slash game (therefore 'slack'), in which
you explore dungeons and pwn monsters. 

This is mainly written for educational purposes, but will be fun to write
nonetheless.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'slack'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install slack

*Note*: This has a ncurses / curses dependency for pretty menus.

## Usage

Run

   $ slack

And you should be in game.
